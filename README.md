# logistic-regression
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and
you want to determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their
results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants
that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training
example, you have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions
decision.

Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s
probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.
